## What is HTML?
To publish information for global distribution, one needs a universally
understood language, a kind of publishing language that all computers
may potentially understand. The publishing language used by the World
Wide Web is HTML (from Hyper Text Markup Language).

## Uses of HTML
• Publish online documents with headings, texts, tables, lists, photos, etc.

• Retrieve online information via hypertexts links.

• Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.

• Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.

## Tag
• A tag is a reference in an HTML document which describes the style and structure of the document.

• All tag start with < (less than symbol) and end with > (greater than symbol)

• Tags which mark a beginning have no / (front slash).
